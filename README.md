# Probabilistic Safety for BNNs

This is Code for the paper: Probabilistic Safety for Bayesian Neural Networks

NB: Some files are lablled 'ProbablisticReachability' these compute probablistic safety and will soon be refactored.

### Repository Organization:

MNIST: Code for MNIST experiments. This has seperation between 1 and 2 layer networks.


VCAS: Code for VCAS experiments. Compile the dataset first before running verification or training script


SimpleSafetyExample: Run 'SimpleReachability' notebook to train and get first figure in paper. Run ProblemInsights to get figure two. Further exploration in ProcessInsights
